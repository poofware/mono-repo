            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 24, 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Poof! This Privacy Policy explains how Poof LLC ("Poof," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our website (thepoofapp.com), our Poof Worker mobile application (the "App"), and the services we provide (collectively, the "Services").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in a few different ways:</p>
            
            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create a Poof Worker account, we collect your first and last name, email address, and phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> To complete your profile, we collect your home address (including street, city, state, and zip code) and vehicle information (year, make, and model).</li>
                <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly for support, we may receive additional information about you, such as the contents of your message and any other information you choose to provide.</li>
                <li><strong>Website Inquiries:</strong> If you express interest in our services as a Property Manager or a Worker through our website, we collect your email address.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We collect your precise geolocation data through the App when you are "online" or actively performing a job. This is essential for finding nearby jobs, providing navigation, and verifying job start and completion times and locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Device and Security Information:</strong> We automatically collect information about your mobile device, including a unique device identifier, to secure your account. We also use device attestation services (such as Google's Play Integrity API on Android and Apple's App Attest on iOS) to verify that your requests are coming from a genuine and secure version of our App. This involves sending a device integrity token and a key identifier to our servers for validation.</li>
                <li><strong>Job-Related Information:</strong> When you perform a job, we collect photographs you take as proof of service completion. We also log your check-in and completion times.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3>
            <p>To provide our services securely and efficiently, we partner with third-party service providers. In some cases, they collect information directly from you on our behalf.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Background Checks (Checkr):</strong> We use Checkr, Inc. to conduct background checks. We will initiate the process by providing your email to Checkr. You will then provide your sensitive information (such as your Social Security Number) directly to Checkr through their secure platform. We do not receive or store this sensitive information; we only receive the final status of the background check (e.g., "Approved" or "Pending"). Checkr's collection and use of your data is governed by their <a href="https://checkr.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Processing & Identity Verification (Stripe):</strong> We use Stripe, Inc. to manage payouts and verify your identity. To set up your payment account (via Stripe Connect) and verify your identity (via Stripe Identity), you will be directed to Stripe's secure platform. You will provide your bank account details, government-issued ID, and other required information directly to Stripe. We do not see or store your sensitive financial or identity document information. This process is governed by Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including matching you with available jobs.</li>
                <li>Verify your identity and conduct background checks.</li>
                <li>Process payments and payouts.</li>
                <li>Communicate with you, including sending service updates and responding to support requests.</li>
                <li>Ensure the security and integrity of our platform.</li>
                <li>Prevent fraud and enforce our terms of service.</li>
                <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party vendors and service providers that help us operate our Services, such as Checkr (for background checks), Stripe (for payments and identity verification), Google (for mapping and location services), and cloud hosting providers.</li>
                <li><strong>With Property Managers:</strong> We may share limited, non-sensitive operational data with property managers, such as the status of a job (e.g., "Completed") to confirm service delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it's required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>You may have certain rights regarding your personal information, subject to local data protection laws. You can typically review and update your account information by logging into the App and visiting the "My Profile" section. For other requests or questions about your rights, please contact us.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other means. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
